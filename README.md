## Project Overview 

Skin cancer is a crucial health issue that requires timely detection for higher survival rates. Traditional computer vision techniques face challenges in addressing the advanced variability of skin lesion features, a gap partially bridged by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To overcome the existing issues, we introduce an innovative convolutional ensemble network approach named deep autoencoder (DAE) with VGG19 & ResNet101. This method utilizes convolution-based deep neural networks for the detection of skin cancer. The ISIC-2018 public data taken from the source is used for experimental results, which demonstrate remarkable performance with the different in terms of performance metrics.
